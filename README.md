## UFSC Academic Exercises and Projects Repository

This repository is a collection of my academic exercises and projects completed during my time at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC).

## About the Repository
Throughout my academic journey at UFSC, I have completed a variety of projects and exercises across different subjects and disciplines. I created this repository to showcase my work and provide a centralized location for potential employers and collaborators to view my academic portfolio.
